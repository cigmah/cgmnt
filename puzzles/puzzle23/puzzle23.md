# Run! (Preclinical)

> This puzzle was released on 2019-09-21, and was the Abstract puzzle for the theme *Run!*.

It's 7:00am. Facing North, you walk through the corridor on the 6th wall.

You have accepted your fate at this point. There is a strange clarity in your head as you enter the room. You're not sad. You're not scared. You're not even tired.

You sit down at the computer. But just as you reach for the mouse...

There's a loud grumble.

You look up at the ceiling. Nope, nothing.

You look back at the computer screen...wait, huh?

---

That was five minutes ago. You are currently being chased by an indignant computer-shaped medical lecturer. How did this happen? Why did this happen? These are questions with unnecessarily implausible answers, so conjure it up in your imagination because it'd surely be more realistic than what actually occurred.

"Answer my *preclinical* questions, you coffee-spilling cannula-dropping poorly-scrubbed intern!"

Oh dear. This medical lecturer is not happy with you. In fact, he will only let you go if you manage to correctly answer his 40 preclinical True-or-False questions in 60 seconds without making a mistake. Out of pity though, he has given you a choice of either doing Year 1-focused questions or Year 2-focused questions. A pity that his pity only reaches so far...

Will you be able to do it? Why is he shaped like a computer? Are you hallucinating? There's only one way to find out...

## Input

The puzzle can be played at [https://cgmnt-run-run-run-run.netlify.com/](https://cgmnt-run-run-run-run.netlify.com/). You can choose to do *either* the **Year 1** or **Year 2** question sets - both yield the same codeword.

## Statement

Enter the codeword found after successfully answering 40 True-or-False preclinical questions in 60 seconds.

The correct solution was `CITYCORCIMFO`.

## Explanation

### Map Hint

You did it! The computer-shaped medical lecturer glares at you and walks away. You make your way back to the room. There's no computer there anymore (well, of course, the computer was really just a computer-shaped medical lecturer in the first place) but there's a piece of paper. It reads:

```
The minimum number of rooms between the start room and the exit room is an odd number.
```

How mildly helpful.

### Writer's Notes

This was a simple puzzle from a coding perspective, but the questions took a significant amount of time to write. As always, this was coded with Elm but there was very little actual code involved - most of our efforts went into forming the questions and their explanations. We hope that this will be of help to students as exams approach.

The source code for this puzzle will be released after the puzzle hunt ends.
