> This puzzle was released on 2019-05-11, and was the Abstract puzzle for the theme *A Little Logic*.

You're still stuck in the library. Maybe you'll spend the rest of your life here.

It's 3:00am. Facing North, you walk through the corridor on the 4th wall.

1. Localise the lesions on the puzzle board.
2. You have 10 lesions to localise in a row.
3. You have 5 minutes to get through all 10 levels.
4. Get *one* level wrong and you have to restart from the very beginning.
5. Every level is randomly generated. You won't see the same level twice.
6. There may be multiple answers; as long as yours is correct, it will progress.
7. It gets progressively harder.
8. Once you have completed the 10 levels, you will be shown a codeword.
9. Submit the codeword as your answer.

Good luck.

## Explanation

### Map Hint

You reflect on the logic in neurology. Perhaps it would be easier to learn all these pathways if they could be shown interactively.

 You open the file `map_hint.txt`.

 ```
 The key is:

 enalgunanaqueldealgunhexagonorazonaronloshombresdebeexistirunlibroquesealacifrayelcompendioperfectodetodoslosdemasalgunbibliotecarioloharecorridoyesanalogoaundios

 When deciphering, preserve the capitalisation of the original map text and skip
 non alphabetic characters, leaving them as they are.

 ```

 Well this is finally useful.

### Writer's Notes

We sincerely apologise, but our Writer's Notes for this month are very sparse.
We have provided our solutions, but that's it for now. A proper writeup
including the data generation will come in due course.

This puzzle is deliberately difficult. We wrote it in Elm (and had it written a while ago, just refined it for the puzzle hunt) and will release the source code as well as a proper write up on our main site in due course. Time isn't our friend at the moment.
