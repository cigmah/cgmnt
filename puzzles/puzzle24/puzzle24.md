> This puzzle was released on 2019-09-21, and was the Beginner puzzle for the theme *Run!*.

It's 7:20am. Facing North, you walk through the corridor on the 5th wall.

That was a weird room. You hope you're still keeping it together.

You sit down at the computer. But just as you reach for the mouse...

There's a loud grumble.

Oh no, not again. You...look up at the ceiling. Nope, nothing.

You close your eyes. Take a breath. You open your eyes.

You look back at the computer screen...sigh.

That was five minutes ago, again. You are currently being chased by a furious mouse-shaped surgical consultant. What's going on? Why is this happening to you? These are questions with gorgeously trivial answers, so conjure it up in your imagination because it'd surely be more fleshed out than what actually is.

"Answer my *clinical* questions, you spiel-rehearsing file-retrieving formally-dressed intern!"

Oh dear. This surgical consultant is not happy with you. In fact, she will only let you go if you manage to correctly answer her 40 clinical True-or-False questions in 60 seconds without making a mistake. Out of pity though, she has given you a choice of **either** doing Year 3-focused questions or Year 4-focused questions. A pity that her pity only reaches so far...

Will you be able to do it? Why is she shaped like a mouse? Are you hallucinating? There's only one way to find out...

### Addendum (2019/10/04)

You take a sneak peak at the next room...and it's a dead-end. There's no computer in the room, but instead a sign with the letters `D-H`.

Blast. Where to now? You're no longer filled with determination. It's time to head back and resign yourself to your fate....unless?

## Input

The puzzle can be played at [https://cgmnt-run-run-run-run.netlify.com/](https://cgmnt-run-run-run-run.netlify.com/). You can choose to do *either* the **Year 3** or **Year 4** question sets - both yield the same codeword.

## Statement

Enter the codeword found after successfully answering 40 True-or-False clinical questions in 60 seconds.

## Answer

The correct solution was `REVOOT`.

## Explanation

### Map Hint

You did it! The mouse-shaped surgical consultant glares at you and walks away. You make your way back to the room. There's no computer there anymore (well, of course, the computer was really just the cover for a mouse-shaped surgical lecturer in the first place) but there's a piece of paper. It reads:

```
The minimum number of rooms between the start room and the exit room is greater than 40 but less than 50.
```

How moderately helpful.

### Writer's Notes

This was a simple puzzle from a coding perspective, but the questions took a significant amount of time to write. As always, this was coded with Elm but there was very little actual code involved - most of our efforts went into forming the questions and their explanations. We hope that this will be of help to students as exams approach.

The source code for this puzzle will be released after the puzzle hunt ends.
