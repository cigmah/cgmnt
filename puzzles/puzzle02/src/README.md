# Metabolic Mayhem

This is the source code for the animation for `Metabolic Mayhem`, one of our
sample puzzles.

Unfortunately, the source code is very messy at the moment; hopefully, we can
clean this up one day and make it more presentable.

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm
App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
