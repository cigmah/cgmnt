Out of respect for participants' privacy, the Puzzle Hunt database was deleted
without backup after this document was made, and we no longer have participants'

Most participants registered using generic email addresses (Gmail, Hotmail,
Live, Outook, Yahoo). A large portion were from Monash University, and a small
portion from other educational or research institutions (University of
Melbourne, University of East Anglia, Princeton University, Inserm). A small
portion registered using disposable email services (SharkLasers, nwytg,
Mailinator, YOPmail, 163), which we believe was a wise choice for short-term
participants with privacy concerns, particularly for participants who were not

Here is a plot showing puzzles and the number of unique users who submitted at
least one submission for each puzzle. This can serve as a rough measure of
popularity.
</p>

<div class="right">
<p>

</p>

<p>
It is hard to measure the intrinsic popularity of each puzzle, given that we
know that later puzzles were less popular by virtue of a later release date. A
more sophisticated model might better be able to estimate the separate
contributions of release dates and puzzle features, but was outside the scope of
this wrap-up.
</p>

</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./figures/popularity.png" alt="popularity.png">

<p>
The two most popular puzzles were Abstract puzzles released early in the Puzzle
Hunt; three of the five most unpopular puzzles were Challenge puzzles.

<h3 id="orgdfd4390">Which puzzles were easiest and hardest?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdfd4390">
<p>
We can get a general sense of the "difficulty" of each puzzle by comparing how
many incorrect submissions were received with how many correct submissions were
received.
</p>

<div class="right">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Assessing the difficulty of puzzles varies on how difficulty is defined, given
that difficult puzzles may have either been a) unapproachable (and therefore
received few submissions), or b) deceptive (and therefore received submissions
more likely to be incorrect). We have chosen the second definition, given that
we have described the popularity of puzzles in the section above, but
"difficulty" here should be interpreted in the context of popularity as well.
</p>

<p>
Note this graph differs from the previous graph - this graph tallies total
<i>submissions</i> including those from the same participant; the previous graph
tallies only the number of participants who submitted at least one solution to
each puzzle.
</p>

</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./figures/difficulties.png" alt="difficulties.png">
</p>
</div>

<p>
The puzzle with the highest ratio of incorrect to correct submissions was the
Meta puzzle <i>Lost in a Library</i> (8 incorrect submissions for every 1 correct
submission), though interestingly the puzzle with the highest absolute number of
incorrect submissions was the Abstract sample puzzle, <i>Metabolic Mayhem</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Metabolic Mayhem</i> was cast as a sample puzzle as it consisted of the
interpretation of an abstract animation, which we believed too ambiguous to be
included in the main puzzle hunt (and which appears to have been a correct
decision).
</p>

<div class="right">
<p>

</p>

<p>
This puzzle depicted an abstract animation of a metabolic pathway in a normal
and a pathological state. The metabolic pathway consisted of an unknown particle
being carried by gradually-diminishing particles through the blood stream before
being cleared by receptors from an unknown organ; in the pathological state,
these particles accumulated in the bloodstream due to dysfunctional receptors.
Participants were asked to determine the gene mutation involved in the
pathological state.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Out of interest for this particular puzzle, here were some of the responses
received:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./figures/metabolic_mayhem_responses.png" alt="metabolic_mayhem_responses.png">
</p>
</div>

<p>
The intended correct answer was LDLR; however, it was very interesting to see
the wide array of genes people could draw parallels to in the abstract
depiction. We are interested in the ways abstract modelling might similarly be
able to make different pathways relatable, and while these may not be suitable
as puzzles for inclusion into the Puzzle Hunt, we will look for an avenue for
these to return.
</p>


<div class="right">
<p>

</p>

<p>
All game-type puzzles were entirely client-side; we made our best efforts to
obscure the answers from the client-side code (including the fact that the code
was transpiled from Elm to JavaScript and minified), but these puzzles are not
uncrackable. Although, as we are a coding group, we believe it just as valid to
have derived the solution from the client-side code as it is from pursuing the
"intended" solution path - after all, it is also interesting to think of how to
use code to examine the internals of the tools we use and derive useful (but
hidden) information.
</p>

</div>

<p>
A number of puzzles had no incorrect submissions, though these had a low number
of submissions in total and are therefore hard to interpret. Most of these were
game-type puzzles, which divulged the solution after you completed the game -
and in such cases, there was no chance of submitting an incorrect solution at
all unless participants guessed or attempted to derive the solution from the
client-side code.

<p>
The source code for all components of the Puzzle Hunt are available from
<a href="https://github.com/cigmah/cgmnt">https://github.com/cigmah/cgmnt</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Puzzle Hunt backend and frontend were written in late January and early
February using Python and Elm.
</p>

<p>
The backend used the Django REST Framework and handled all the core
functionality based around database interaction (such as adding puzzles,
retrieving released puzzles, handling user registrations) and application logic
(such as scoring submissions, aggregating scores, time-locking excessive
submissions). The backend was kept in a private GitHub repository and hosted on
Heroku, connecting with a PostgreSQL database provided by an additional Heroku
add-on.
</p>

<p>
The frontend was a single-page application written in Elm with custom CSS. It
handled all interactions on the web interface, including navigation, rendering,
and server interactions. The frontend was kept in a public GitHub repository and
hosted on GitHub Pages.
</p>

<div class="right">
<p>

</p>

<p>
We changed the Puzzle Hunt website design twice during the Puzzle Hunt as we
wished to refocus the group's target audience and reduce the verbosity of
puzzles by using video introductions instead. This was a mistake on our part and
increased confusion over the user interface. We will not do so again.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Puzzles themselves were written in a mixture of languages; interactive puzzles
were all written with Elm, whereas data analysis puzzles tended to be written in
Python. When graphics were required (such as for each puzzle's Meta Puzzle room
hint), they were made with either <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> (for simple vector graphics) or
<a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> (for full 3D models). Where music or sound effects were required (such
as for several of the game-type puzzles), they were made with <a href="https://musescore.org/en">MuseScore</a>.

We budgeted for 25 puzzle prizes, but one Puzzle Prize was unclaimed, three

It is often tradition for the winner/s of a Puzzle Hunt to arrange the next
Puzzle Hunt, but we know this request does not come lightly and there is no
precedent for this particular Puzzle Hunt. Whether or not we are able to deliver
on this tradition remains to be seen, but we hope that the Puzzle Hunt can
handover its management and evolve over time.

Should the Puzzle Hunt continue, we have consolidated the following suggestions
based on data from this Puzzle Hunt:

<h4 id="orge65f099">Suggestions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge65f099">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Conduct the Puzzle Hunt on a single day or a single weekend</b>.
Participation was greatest at the start of the Puzzle Hunt. We maintained the
Puzzle Hunt over the year as our primary intent for the Puzzle Hunt was to
encourage medical students to learn how to code over time, but this did not
appear to be successful; most active participants were experienced coders. A
single day or weekend, possibly with a pre-Puzzle Hunt coding bootcamp, may
be easier for new medical students/coders to manage with busy schedules and
with less commitment required. This would also be less costly.</li>
<li><b>Orient puzzles towards abstract, visual or gamified learning.</b>
Our puzzles ranged from abstract games requiring no actual coding, to
concrete statistical or data science problems requiring a significant amount
of programming knowledge. Although the latter category is arguably more
"useful", the former category was far more popular. It may be useful, as far
as possible, to investigate how elements of gamified learning can be
used to make the data analysis-type puzzles more fun and bridge the gap
between the two categories.</li>
<li><b>Simplify the technology stack.</b>
The development of a full-stack application for the Puzzle Hunt was a good
opportunity for the management team to learn, but not necessary for the
Puzzle Hunt itself. The technology stack could be greatly simplified, such as
using a backend server performing server-side rendering and foregoing the
frontend entirely.</li>

CIGMAH is working on An Open Revision Tool for Assessments (AORTA) (currently
hosted at <a href="https://aorta.netlify.com/">https://aorta.netlify.com/</a>), a free and open-source medical note and
question bank. There's not enough content there for it to be useful yet, but
most of the coding is done and we're working on adding content. We're always
looking for help, so do get in touch if you are interested.
</p>

<p>
We are also looking at hosting more tutorial nights on a range of coding topics,
recommencing next year. The topics we host tutorial nights on are not yet
decided, but we will try to cover fun, interesting and relevant material for
medical students. Suggestions for tutorial night topics are highly welcomed.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we are interested in beginning a game development project for
practising medical cases, possibly in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">interactive fiction</a> text
adventures such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a> or <a href="http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2FTangle.z5">Spider &amp; Web</a>. We were originally looking at
