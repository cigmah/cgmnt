Want to learn but don't know where to start? We've been there too.

We're hoping to run a puzzle hunt from the beginning of March to the end of
September.

At the beginning of each month, a puzzle set will be released themed around a
medical specialty and a topic within programming. We aim to choose topics especially
relevant to medicine to get the most value out of these puzzles. Most puzzles will
be aimed at beginners and will usually require some (short) coding to solve.

You, or a team, have the month to solve the puzzle and will earn points
depending on how quickly within the month you solved it. Most beginner puzzles
should be solvable within 10 minutes if you are familiar with the problem
domain, but as everyone has busy schedules, we want to accommodate a flexible
timeframe.

At the end of the month, the puzzle submissions will be locked and a
step-by-step solution posted.

At the end of September, the points earned by each team will be tallied and a
winner will be announced. But, forget the winner, you'll have come away with
a set of new skills that you can build upon!

We're aiming for it to be a bit like a medically-themed, beginner-friendly
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Don't worry, we've got you.

We're aiming to provide a beginner's template with each puzzle to reduce the
friction of learning how to code.

The beginner's templates will be offered in [Python](https://www.python.org) and
[Julia](https://julialang.org) - two very flexible languages with strong ties
with the scientific and medical data ecosystems.

These templates will be provided as online [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
notebooks, which you can run inside your browser. It will walk you through
step-by-step through the puzzle and provide some 'fill in the blank' style
coding exercises that target the learning objective very specifically.

We are still working on the details, but our hope is to offer this experience
straight from the browser - no need to install anything, just follow the link to
the template and go.
