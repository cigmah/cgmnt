We're looking for volunteers! We are believers in
[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and are
currently maintained by a group of passionate volunteers. If you'd like to
volunteer as tribute, we're looking for:

- Puzzle writers (considerable experience in either Python or Julia, or any great ideas)
- Puzzle testers (no experience needed)

And of course, we're also looking for members and participants! Stay tuned for
the 2019 Puzzle Hunt :)
