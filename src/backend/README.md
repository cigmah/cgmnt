# README

This was the backend code used for the CIGMAH '19 Puzzle Hunt.

The code in this repository is not idiomatic and should not be used in the
future. Most notably, the application logic is included in the *views*, when it
is much better separated out into a separate module. There is also unnecessary
repetition in the *serializers*. 

The code here is included for posterity's sake. Having written this code, we
have now learnt better and would make a significant number of changes to its
architecture.
