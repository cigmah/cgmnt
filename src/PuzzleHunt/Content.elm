Welcome to the 2019 CIGMAH Puzzle Hunt!

If you would like to participate, please register. It is quick and simple, and
we only require a username and an email (though your name would be helpful if
you win a prize.)

Here are the puzzle hunt instructions:

1. On the first Saturday of each month at 4PM, a set of puzzles will be released around a theme.
2. Puzzles come in three flavours:
    - A (Abstract): Coding principles, but you can solve these with a sharp mind and pen-and-paper!
    - B (Beginner): Basic coding required and we'll provide you with some guidance for these.
    - C (Challenge): Hard puzzles for hardcore programmers, with limited guidance.
3. The puzzles will accept submissions for 25 days.
4. If you submit and get it right, you will score points based on when within the 25 days you solved it (minimum 50, max 100).
5. If you submit and get it wrong, you will not lose points, but will have to wait a certain amount of time before resubmitting.
6. The amount of time you have to wait increases exponentially for each incorrect submission.
7. Once you get the puzzle right, the worked solution becomes immediately available for you.
8. At the end of 25 days, submissions for that theme are locked and solutions will become available for everyone.
9. A concurrent meta-puzzle will run for the duration of the Puzzle Hunt.
9. At the end of September (7 puzzle sets), the leaderboard will be tallied and prizes will be awarded for:
    1. The participant with the most points in the Abstract set
    2. The participant with the most points in the Beginner set
    3. The participant with the most points in the Challenge set
    4. The participant who answered the meta puzzle correctly first.
    5. The participant with the most points in total across all puzzles in all sets.
10. A participant cannot win both the Beginner and Challenge prize, but any other combination is permitted.

And some rules:

1. You are free to participate as a team, but you must register with the same account and are only permitted to use one device at a time.
2. If you participate in a team, we suggest that teams are limited to three people or less.
3. Please do not share solutions if you have solved it correctly and the puzzle is still open.
   We would like everyone to have an opportunity to solve it for themselves, and puzzle solutions will be available to all users when a puzzle closes after 25 days.
4. Please do not use obviously inappropriate usernames. We will remove users who do.

Happy puzzling!

Don't worry, we've got you.

We're aiming to provide a beginner's template with each puzzle to reduce the
friction of learning how to code.

The beginner's templates will be offered in [Python](https://www.python.org) and
[Julia](https://julialang.org) - two very flexible languages with strong ties
with the scientific and medical data ecosystems.

These templates will be provided as online [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)
notebooks, which you can run inside your browser. It will walk you through
step-by-step through the puzzle and provide some 'fill in the blank' style
coding exercises that target the learning objective very specifically.

We are still working on the details, but our hope is to offer this experience
straight from the browser - no need to install anything, just follow the link to
the template and go.
