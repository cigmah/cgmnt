    """

Healthcare is rapidly changing. Doctors are in a privileged position of being
able to evaluate the clinical value of technology, but may lack the skills
needed in recognising both the technical power and limitations of modern tools.
Having an understanding of how the tools we use work is an important step to
using them skilfully. As tools evolve and become more pervasive, it's inevitable
that we will need to adopt new skillsets to not be left behind.

butConcentrate =
    """

We don't believe there's any harm in extra knowledge. There is a lot of content
in medical school, but we believe medical students will find coding a breath of
fresh air. Learning to code can offer new perspectives in learning *how* to
think, rather than *what* to think, and can leave an impact on how you approach
problem solving regardless of whether you remember the specific details. Instead
of memory-intensive learning, coding is often an exercise in logical thinking.
Checking documentation is easy and encouraged. Programs are (mostly) verifiable
constructs. There's no more putting your faith in information simply because
someone higher-ranked told you so - information is free, open and derivable.

"""


whatCanDo =
    """

Coding is used in many medically-related domains. Doctors are not software
engineers, but they do not have to be to have an appreciation of code.
Inter-disciplinary interaction occurs in fields such as:

- Epidemiology and data analysis in public health
- Healthcare pattern recognition tools driven by artificial intelligence
- Clinician or patient-facing web and mobile applications for streamlined healthcare
- Interactive and visual educational materials
- Medical imaging and biomedical engineering software
- Automation of administrative tasks

Whether or not you end up applying coding in these domains, we still believe
that coding develops skills in problem-solving, systems thinking and rigorous
verification - all very handy skills for any clinical doctor.

"""


whatCIGMAH =
    """

CIGMAH is a new group of medical students interested in coding. We aim to host a
flagship Puzzle Hunt this year as a medically-themed, interactive way to begin
learning how to code. In the future, we hope that we may grow enough to sustain
regular activities such as tutorials, guest lectures, social events and
networking opportunities.
